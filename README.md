# comparison-ranker
A simple python script for helping you rank a list of things by prompting you to put them up against eachother. First created to help my girlfriend find her favourite Taylor Swift songs.

## Instructions for use
1. Open `input.txt` and add your list of items to compare, all items should be on a seperate line
2. Run `startup.py`, if you have any data in your data.txt you will be prompted to create a backup
3. Run `main.py` you will be prompted to choose from 2 random items by entering 1 or 2.
4. Endless mode will continue until you `ctrl+c`
5. Open `data.txt` to see the current overall ranking - this is updated after each comparison
